Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

Note: For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

Example 1:

Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: "race a car"
Output: false

Note: 
 - alphanumeric is a character that is either a letter or a number.
 - A palindrome is a sequence of characters 
   which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam, racecar
